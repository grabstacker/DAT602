# DAT602

## Week1

This week we looked into the course outline and were introduced to the main content of the course.

The course is based around an assignment with SQL

We are to make a SQL based game that uses tiles for movement.
My theme is crypto currency and the aim of the game is to collect the coins when they appear which also includes multiplier bonuses that randomly appear.

I have installed the required MYSQL community package and configured to run on localhost:3000

Tuple is a group od information

The idea behind relational databases is to link information between records using foriegn keys and idetifiers which also is represented in UML diagrams nicley.

a flat file consists of only one set of data such as an excel spreedsheet

Data is these tables are thought of in terms of logical sets of records

logical sets - tables

Creating a table
CREATE TABLE tablename(col1 data_type,col2 datatype)

A student will have a student id, This id is likly to be used as a unique identifier

Creating a table that is a join table would link a table with the primary key courseid and student id

A composit key is a key that is made from a table that has 2 primary forign keys in a join table

DataTypes
each platofrm has different types that are similar to other platforms but the do vary

EXAMPLES

create table tblStudent(StudentID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , StudentName VARCHAR(10))

create table tblCourse(CourseID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, CourseName VARCHAR(10))

INSERT INTO tblStudent (StudentName) VALUES ("Brad")

    INSERT INTO Student (StudentName,Age) VALUES ("Brad", 32)

SELECT col1, col2 FROM tableName Where col1 == col2

SUM(PROD_STOCK\*PROD_UNIT) AS TOTAL_STOCKWORTH FROM TBL_PRODUCT

CROSS PRODUCT is two tables being manipulated into a view

delimiter creates a procedure to store to use later

DELIMITER \\\\\\\\\\\\\\$\$

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_name()
BEGIN
-- statements
END \\\\\\\\\\\\\\$\$

DELIMITER ;

call sp_name();

Test sub routines outside of the routine to check that it is working before commiting it to the procedure

Using releational databases CREATE DELETE UPDATE

THE CRUD

THE STORY BOARDS

HOMEWORK -- practice common mysql queries
still working on the brief

draw a storyboard of what happens in the game
highscores must be created aswell
Logged in status
as someone else is needed to be seen online to try play against someone

## Week 3

09/03/2020

Today CRUD is being discussed for our project milestone Create Update and Delete tables

Logical ERD and Storyboards for the game needs to be completed
The logical erd diagram is located in the sessions 4-5 which includes the UML diagram that was discussed last class. Pictures of the brainstorming were taken and are stored on phone.

Currently looking at logic of the UML and the specific characters abilities ( or what can this class do!) The Player

Does the character have a ascore or the player have a score

What is the UML going to look like when moved over to the storyboard?

STORYBOARD

Literally drawing story of what happens when you run the game, brainistorm about what fields from what classes are used on each storyboard

Storyboard requires detailed statements underneath the image, 1 2 3 4 steps etc for the code logic

Sometimes in order to pass the correct information into the login you may need to post the entire object as the majority of the fields or properties of the player class that has been instatiated are required. This is mainly just neat code ethics

Register UML "sorry the email does not exsit" "try again"

Where is the update class being called from and what is it doing
does it just update the screen or does it handle manipulation on the fields and properties themselves.

Character may have a tileID where the character is currently positioned on the map. Do the players keep track of where they are posistioned?
I think yes as having a central coordinator keeping track of multiple locations and players could get messy

LAYOUT

CRUD Table NEEDS ATTENTION

Login
retrieve all the required fields like name and password from the database where the login and password matches the login and password of the user.
A method to delete a player must be implemented
Creation of the character class. Instantiation

    PRODUCE a CRUD table for the game design

    ERD diagram with notation

## Week 3 Class 2 10/02/2020

Talking about transactional sql which is a little bit more primitive than other languages as you can use things like the goto statement
Flow control sstatements let you repeat certain areas of the code.

flow control statements
case
if
iterate
leave
loop
repeat
return
while

HOMEWORK

Do stored procedures for homework in the class 4-5 session notes

## Week 4 15-03-2020

----Update----
UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY][ignore] table_reference
SET assignment_list
[WHERE where_condition][order by ...]
[LIMIT row_count]

value:
{expr | DEFAULT}

assignment:
col_name = value

assignment_list:
assignment [, assignment] ...

    update employee
      set age = age + 1
        where first_name = "mary" AND last_name = "williams";

----Delete-----

Delete from table where condition

Delete from employees <-- this will delete the entire table>

delete from employees where officeCode = 4;

delete from table_name order by coloum1, coloumn2 limit row_count

delete from customers order by sutomerName limit 10; <-- un likly query to run>

decending is the default order by statement

delete from customers where country = "france" order by creaditLimit LIMIT 5;

You must define the parent before the child

foriegn keys must be set with an add constraint statement

-----Milestone One Due: Wednesday-----

select insert update delete for each of the tables just to show that the tables and working and thier corrosponding joins work, inseret some data that is relevaint to the tables to get some kind of results returned he wants it put into a seperate sql files in a folder and he should be able to run it easily on his system.

Not required to do any joins at this point

Uniory table is a one to many connecting to itself

# Stored procedures and functions in sql

We are discussing procedures and functions and their return types

definer: declears permissions for the query and overides proceding code

Definer = admin@localhost

mysql> delimiter //

mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE citycount (IN country CHAR(3), OUT cities INT)
BEGIN
SELECT COUNT(\*) INTO cities FROM world.city
WHERE CountryCode = country;
END//
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> delimiter ;

Creating a Stored Procedure

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE `p2` ()
LANGUAGE SQL
DETERMINISTIC
SQL SECURITY DEFINER
COMMENT 'A procedure'
BEGIN
SELECT 'Hello World !';
END//

---

Out example

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE `proc_OUT` (OUT var1 VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
SET var1 = 'This is a test';
END //

Declear sets variables in sql
variables only exsist inside the subroutine

Begin
Declear a, b INT DEFAULT 5;
insert into table1 value (a);
end
