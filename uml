1 game has many pools with different hashrates and multpliers depending 
on the random generation of a range of realistic numbers to make the pools
switching power more "profitiable". 1 pool can generate many bitcoins and multiplers
to increase the power of the players miner generating a hiScore. A Player can join 1 
game and not many games to enure the players account is only played in one instance.
1 player can aquire many Bitcoins which vary in totalValue. 1 Pool can have many players
which generate larger multipliers for the players. 1 player can have only 1 multiplier which
resets when you log out. 1 multiplier can have only one player which is the player that gets
to the tile first. 1 tile can have one player. 1 tile can have one bitcoin. 1 tile can have 1 
multiplier. This ensures players and objects only occupie one space at a time making movement
harder.
